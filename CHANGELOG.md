# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-13

- Added `src/TrashCollectionApi.ts`: typed accessor for the Trash Collection plugin's public API — `getTrashCollectionApi(app)` returns the API object or null if the plugin isn't loaded or version-mismatches; used by the `orphan` slot type

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-13

Initial release.

### Core block

- `continue-note` fenced code block renders a preview of your most recently accessed note
- Clickable title opens the note in the current leaf
- Relative timestamp and Breadcrumbs parent chain shown under the title (falls back to filesystem folder if Breadcrumbs isn't installed)
- Trash button (hover to reveal) sends the note to system trash and re-renders to the next candidate
- Inline markdown rendering via `MarkdownRenderer.render` — wikilinks, bold, lists, headings all render live

### Smart truncation

- Finds the last `##` section and shows the tail so you see where you left off
- Line cap scales logarithmically with note length: short notes show more, long notes show fewer
- Notes under the short-note threshold are always shown in full
- "Skipping N lines" label instead of ellipsis, so you know how much was omitted
- Fence-aware slicing: never starts a snippet inside a fenced code block

### Multi-slot support

- Show any number of notes per block, each from a different source
- Block-level slot syntax: `opened: 1`, `modified: 4`, `orphan: 2` etc.
- Sources: `modified`, `created`, `frontmatter` (any date property), `opened` (last-opened tracking, persisted across restarts), `orphan`
- Notes are deduped across slots so the same file never appears twice
- Hard cap on total notes shown (`maxTotal`, default 6)

### Trash Collection integration

- `orphan` slot type integrates with the [Trash Collection](../obsidian-trash-collection) plugin via its public `api.getCandidates()` method
- All orphan detection logic (age threshold, exclusions, conditions) comes from Trash Collection's own settings — no duplicate config
- Silently skipped if Trash Collection isn't installed

### Frontmatter display

- Optional `frontmatter:` block config key (or global setting) lists properties to show as chips under the title
- Arrays are joined with commas; missing fields are silently omitted

### Developer experience

- `.env`-based vault path: set `OBSIDIAN_CONFIG_FOLDER` and `npm run dev` auto-copies to the vault on every rebuild
- `.hotreload` file created automatically for use with the Hot Reload plugin
- `npm run build` compiles only — no copy

### Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sort by | modified | Signal used to rank notes globally |
| Frontmatter date field | date-modified | Property name when sort is `frontmatter` |
| Max notes total | 6 | Hard cap across all slots |
| Notes to show | 1 | Default count when no slots are specified |
| Excluded folders | — | Global path prefixes to ignore |
| Frontmatter fields | — | Properties to display as chips |
| Smart mode | on | Log-scaled tail truncation |
| Max lines (smart ceiling) | 10 | Upper bound for smart cap |
| Short note threshold | 9 | Lines below which the full note is shown |
| Max lines | 6 | Fallback when smart mode is off or no `##` found |
